# Groovy Implicit Type Conversion and Null Handling

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to Groovy's implicit type conversion and how it interacts with null values and collections. The `bug.groovy` file showcases the inconsistent behavior, while `bugSolution.groovy` presents a robust solution.

The core issue stems from Groovy's flexible type system. While seemingly convenient, this flexibility can mask unexpected behavior if not handled carefully.  The example highlights how attempting to handle null values directly can lead to incorrect results or runtime exceptions when dealing with more complex types such as collections.  The solution emphasizes explicit type checking and safe handling of potential null values or unexpected types to prevent such problems.
